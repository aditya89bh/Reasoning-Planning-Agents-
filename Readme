# 🧠 Reasoning & Planning Agents  
_From Memory to Deliberate Autonomy_

This repository explores **reasoning and planning as core cognitive capabilities** in AI agents.

Rather than focusing on prompt tricks or tool orchestration, this work treats agents as **decision-making systems** that:
- learn from past outcomes
- reuse successful strategies
- avoid repeated failures
- decompose goals into executable plans
- reason explicitly before acting
- plan across long time horizons

These projects build on prior work in memory agents and move toward **agents that can think, decide, and adapt over time**.

## Why This Repository Exists

Most agents today:
- react to prompts
- execute tasks independently
- plan from scratch every time
- repeat the same failures
- lack internal judgment

Humans don’t work this way.

We rely on:
- memory-conditioned strategies
- explicit reasoning
- goal decomposition
- failure avoidance
- long-horizon planning

This repository is an attempt to **engineer those cognitive loops explicitly**.

## What This Repo Is (and Isn’t)

**This repo is:**
- a study of agent cognition
- architecture-first
- outcome-driven
- transparent and inspectable

**This repo is not:**
- a chatbot demo
- a prompt engineering cookbook
- a framework wrapper
- a production SaaS

## Project Map

Each project isolates one core planning or reasoning capability, while remaining composable into a larger cognitive system.

1. **Memory-Conditioned Planner**  
   Plans are scored and selected based on past outcomes.

2. **Explicit Reasoning Loop Agent**  
   Reasoning is structured, evidence-backed, and auditable.

3. **Goal Decomposition Planner**  
   Long-term goals are broken into executable subgoals.

4. **Strategy Selection Agent**  
   Agents reuse, adapt, and retire strategies over time.

5. **Failure-Aware Planner**  
   Failures are categorized, remembered, and avoided.

6. **Long-Horizon Planning Agent**  
   Agents plan, monitor, and adapt across extended timelines.

Each project has its own detailed design document and implementation notes.

## Design Principles

- Reasoning is explicit, not implicit
- Planning is evaluated, not assumed
- Memory shapes decisions, not just recall
- Failures are first-class learning signals
- Every decision leaves a trace

---

## How to Use This Repo

- Start with Project 1 and move sequentially  
- Each project can run independently  
- Together, they form a progressively richer cognitive architecture

---

## Big Picture

Memory answers: *What happened?*  
Reasoning answers: *Why did it happen?*  
Planning answers: *What should I do next?*  

This repository is about **closing that loop**.

# Project 03: Goal Decomposition Planner

## Core Question
How does a high-level goal become executable steps?

---

## Problem

Most agents fail not because they cannot act,
but because they cannot **structure intent**.

They either:
- jump directly to actions
- generate shallow task lists
- fail to track dependencies
- restart from scratch after failure

What’s missing is a **goal decomposition layer**.
